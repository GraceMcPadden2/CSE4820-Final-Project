# CSE4820-Final-Project
Computer Vision Weapon Detection
Isabelle Perez and Grace McPadden

	Gun violence remains a significant issue in the United States, with over 46,000 gun related deaths in 2023 alone. Effective surveillance is critical for early threat detection, but human operators monitoring live footage have significant limitations. Studies show that after just 20-40 minutes of continuous monitoring, human operators can develop video blindness and fatigueâ€“ leading to an inaccuracy rate of up to 83% (Yadav). This demonstrates a need for automated weapon detection in surveillance footage. For this project, we aim to automate weapon detection by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and locate guns in still images from CCTV footage.
